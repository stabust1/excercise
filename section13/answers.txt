1. JavaScript can accept higher-order functions. This ability to handle higher-order functions, among other characteristics, makes JavaScript one of the programming languages well-suited for functional programming.

You may have heard that JavaScript functions are first-class citizens. This means functions in JavaScript are objects.

They have the type Object, they can be assigned as the value of a variable, and they can be passed and returned just like any other reference variable.

First-class functions give JavaScript special powers and enable us to benefit from higher-order functions.

Because functions are objects, JavaScript is one of the popular programming languages that supports a natural approach to functional programming.

In fact, first-class functions are so native to JavaScript’s approach that I bet you’ve been using them without even thinking about it.

2. JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object.
The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called

3. In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

4. The constructor method is a special method used to initialize an object and is created in the class.
There is only one special method named "constructor" in the class. Having more than 1 constructor method in the class will cause a SyntaxError.

A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.

If you do not specify a constructor method, the default constructor will be used

5. Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

6. The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method.

It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).

7. Using a callback, you could call the calculator function (myCalculator) with a callback (myCallback), and let the calculator function run the callback after the calculation is finished

8. JavaScript animations can handle things that CSS can’t.

For instance, moving along a complex path, with a timing function different from Bezier curves, or an animation on a canvas.

9. Dot notation is one way to access a property of an object. To use dot notation, write the name of the object, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the property.

10. addEventListener is a method built into HTML objects through the DOM mechanism. Using addEventListener you can add multiple actions to the event at different times.
