1. Create a new function called animatePress(), it should take a single input parameter called currentColour.

2. Take a look inside the styles.css file, you can see there is a class called "pressed", it will add a box shadow and changes the background colour to grey.

3. Use jQuery to add this pressed class to the button that gets clicked inside animatePress().

4. use Google/Stackoverflow to figure out how you can use Javascript to remove the pressed class after a 100 milliseconds.

Once complete, you will get this effect when you click on any button.
