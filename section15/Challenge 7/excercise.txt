1. Use jQuery to detect when a keyboard key has been pressed, when that happens for the first time, call nextSequence().

You'll need a way to keep track of whether if the game has started or not, so you only call nextSequence() on the first keypress.

2. Create a new variable called level and start at level 0.

3. The h1 title starts out saying "Press A Key to Start", when the game has started, change this to say "Level 0".

4. Inside nextSequence(), increase the level by 1 every time nextSequence() is called.

5. Inside nextSequence(), update the h1 with this change in the value of level.
