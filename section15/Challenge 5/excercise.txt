1. In the same way we played sound in nextSequence() , when a user clicks on a button, the corresponding sound should be played. e.g if the Green button is clicked, then green.mp3 should be played.

2. Create a new function called playSound() that takes a single input parameter called name.

3. Take the code we used to play sound in the nextSequence() function and move it to playSound().

4. Refactor the code in playSound() so that it will work for both playing sound in nextSequence() and when the user clicks a button.
